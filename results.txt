NEED TO ANNOTATE SWTCHART JAR!!!

*2342* errors initially (with no SWTChart stubs), possibly including checker bugs and overly conservative annotations.
Started annotation 12:15pm 5/17
Each @UIType annotation seems to fix around 40 errors.  Sometimes 20, sometimes 60.  Once, 107.
After 1:15:00 (hour and 15 minutes, 1:30pm 5/17) down to *704* errors, mostly adding @UIType
annotations to subtypes of JFace and SWT classes, and adding @UI to Runnable and Action.
The bulk of time spent is waiting for the checker to run: it's a ton of code!
15 more minutes of work after a short break: *552*
15 more minutes: *422* after semiautomatically doing the @UIType @UI @UIEffect-ctor transformation for remaining actions
---(now a total of 1 hour 45 minutes)---
15 more (2 hours total): *290*
+15 (2:15): *154*

One of my most common mistakes is not adding the required import statement.
Second most common is probably forgetting to add @UIEffect to a @UIType's constructor

+15 (2:30): *102*
+15 (2:45): *70* one of which may actually be a bug
(at this point I added the warnings about invalid overrides of polymorphic methods with the false
positives, which pushes the total up to 120.  I suspect a few of those 50 new warnings are
legitimate, but most are probably false positives due to the supertype annotation bug)

Have just annotated org.eclipse.jface.preference.IPreferenceStore, which allows property change
listeners to be registered.  Those listeners are fired on the same thread that updates the relevant
property.  As long as the only thread that updates properties with UI listeners is the UI thread,
all is well.  But typing that is a nightmare, because it would require giving a type with a
key->effect map in it.  This doesn't seem problematic in practice, but it's worth noting that by
requiring all of the listeners to be Safe, it is potentially too conservative for some uses.  I also
need to keep this in mind if I find a "bug" in a property change listener.

+15 of actual work (3:00), 57.  Spent a lot of time staring at things and discovered Action is NOT a
polymorphic interface!  It's all safe, and all the setText() calls I was seeing in Action bodies is
just safe bookkeeping, not UI calls.

+45 (3:45), 51.  This includes reversing a lot of incorrect annotations, like making the safe half of a RefreshJob marked safe, and making Action monomorphic (it's always a UI thread thing).
+5 (3:50), 48.  Mostly marking a couple UI constructor calls and fixing misuse of the old RefreshJob
annotations.

+1hour (4:50), 44.  Starting to think Action is completely safe, including the run methods.

Also discovered the IWorkbench.run(...) method (http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbenchWindow.html#run(boolean, boolean, org.eclipse.jface.operation.IRunnableWithProgress)), which we *can't* handle propertly without at least slightly-dependent effects.

+10 (5:00), 30.  Mostly marked a few JFace classes as safe.  The JFace docs do a terrible job of indicating what can be called where.

after fixing some jface annotations,
+20 (5:20), 24.  Mostly from making IPropertyChangeListener polymorphic.

+30 (5:50), 19.  mostly backtracking to mark a bunch of obviously safe methods of UITypes (e.g. containing asyncExec) as SafeEffect.
+15 (6:05), 16.  A couple safe stubs (IStructuredSelection).  Also pretty sure I've found buggy implementations of IPropertyChangeListener.
+15 (6:20), 13.  Found a safe type (PropertySheet) and identified a few nearly-certain bugs.
+5 (6:25), 24.  Upped from some stub file & checker fixes, then marked a @UIType
+20 (6:45), 15.
